# 2.0 System Architecture & Bill of Materials (BOM)

The vessel is not assembled from discrete parts but is “grown” around a central sentient core.

| Component ID       | Component Name        | Material Specification | Fabrication Notes |
|--------------------|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| K1-GC-CORE-001     | Primary K1 Core       | Gravitationally stabilized plasma of metallic hydrogen | The Carrier’s “brain” and “heart,” stabilized in a self-generated magnetic field. |
| K1-GC-HULL-001     | Geomorphic Hull Matrix | Programmable nano-particulate matter | Formed by igniting a stellar-mass gas giant, refined from asteroidal fields. |
| K1-GC-DRONE-001    | Drone Seed Matrix      | Specialized batch of Hull Matrix programmed to form drones | Isolated section ready for act of Generative Transcendence. |
| K1-GC-NAV-001      | Harmonic Resonator Array | Crystalline structures functioning as sensory organs | Grown in deep space, integrated into Carrier’s energy field. |
